### Welcome ðŸ‘‹

<!--![counter](https://[YourEndpoint].m.pipedream.net) needs a pinpoint account-->

My name is Dominik, glad you found this page. I am currently an Associate Platform Engineer at ASOS Ltd.

I'm currently a platform engineer, and formally a data scientist, with experience in DevOps, software development and machine learning. I have experience with Python (number of packages including NumPy and Tensorflow) other languages including, but not limited to: Powershell, Bash, C#, SQL (Postgres, T-SQL). My interests revolve around DevOps, infrastructure automation and Linux while working on personal projects.

In the past, I acquired an MPhys degree at University of Kent and worked as a postgraduate research student at Queen's University Belfast for ~17 months working on astronomical spectroscopy for the ESA Hera mission. For most of the year 2021, I had no formal affiliation before transferring to industry and worked on other projects, including getting onto a competitive ASOS Data Engineering Academy in early 2022.

**My Github profile is not frequently updated, and still needs some work to bring it up to speed!**

### :satellite: Experience

Updated as for late 2022, having worked in IT professionally, alongside my daily amateur shenanigans. I also have limitied computing experience from my days in academia.

- DevOps - Azure Cloud (including Azure DevOps [Repos, Pipelines CI/CD], Powershell and CLI), Docker, Pester, KQL, Grafana, Go (Language).
- Python - I worked with various packages (NumPy, SciPy, AstroPy+Specutils, Pandas, Tensorflow, Keras) for a number of years.
- Bash and Linux SysAdmin (Debian and Arch based systems, Proxmox, familarity with Ansible).
- LaTeX and Markdown
- VCS with Git (obviously)
- HTML+CSS with Hugo Jamstack
- MATLAB - Image processing and numerical methods.
- FORTRAN 95 - The early days of my adventures with programming which also helped with my MPhys project.
- Various other software packages including and not limited to: ESOReflex, SAO DS9, ANSYS Autodyn, Emacs and other useful SysAdmin tools, in particular data managment and recovery (e.g. gparted, photorec).
